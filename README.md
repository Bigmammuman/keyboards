# The Society of the Crossed Keys

In here you will find my growing list of mechanical keyboard design projects, some of which have been run as local or larger GBs with [KeyHive](www.keyhive.xyz).

Please let me know if you have any questions with ordering any PCBs (or let me know if you do it regardless!), or have any questions on how they are designed or function.
