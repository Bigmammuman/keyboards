# The Society of the Crossed Keys

In here you will find my growing list of mechanical keyboard design projects, some of which have been run as local or larger GBs with [KeyHive](https://www.keyhive.xyz).

Please let me know if you have any questions with ordering any PCBs (or let me know if you do it regardless!), or have any questions on how they are designed or function.

Please feel free to open any issues with any cases or PCBs that you have here, and I will do my best to address them!

### Acrylic Case Info

All of my acrylic case files follow the below naming standard:
- All layers are numbered starting with 0, and are numbered up from the bottom
- All layers will be designated with `L<layer number>`
- All feet layers will be designated with `F<layer number>`
- All M3 cases use M3x20mm screws that tap directly into the bottom layer
- All M2 cases will use M3x15+3mm male-to-female brass barrel standoffs where the standoff taps directly into the bottom layer, and M2x6mm screws to screw into the female end of the standoff
- All feet have M4 holes, but I typically have been using M3x14mm screws with M3 nuts on the inside
